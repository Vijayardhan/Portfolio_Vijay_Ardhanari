                        I am a final-year Electronics and Communication Engineering student with a strong foundation in IoT, automation, and electrical testing. I recently completed my project trainee internship at Scrapify Ecotech Pvt. Ltd., where I worked on the Ecofloater water drone project. My experience includes internships at Streamtroops Innovation Lab as PD-Electronics and Vlog Innovation as an IoT intern, where I honed my expertise in electronics product development, testing, and smart technology applications. Additionally, I expanded my software skills through front-end development internships at CodeClause and OasisInfobyte, focusing on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, and Flaskâ€”pursuing web development as a side hobby. I also hold a Lean Six Sigma Foundation certification. Passionate about the intersection of electronics and technology, I thrive on bringing innovative ideas to life, improving efficiency, and contributing to impactful projects.
